# Overview

go_logger is a service log that spawns an agent go-routine to write and manage the log file. This is intended to be used in web or other services that cannot block waiting for logging I/O. Logs can be a file or can be network/remote. The object simply needs to conform to io.Writer and my ReOpener interfaces.
